# layerweekly

Implementation contains following 3 user stories-
1. As an editor in chief, I add a list of topics for the new edition of a magazine. 
2. As a journalist, I submit a draft article for publishing to a given topic 
3. As a copywriter, I suggest changes to the draft article I'm assigned to

### Assumptions:
* Only draft article would be connected to multiple topics but once published would have single reference to Topic
